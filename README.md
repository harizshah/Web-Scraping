# Web-Scraping

First step of my News Article Analysis, I build a web scraping tool with Python. It enables me to download more than 200 news article in minutes. Depends on topic that I'm interested, I can specify Keyword and Pages of result to scrap from Google News. Process goes as below.

- search the specified Keyword (eg. Harimau Malaya),
- scrap articles URL from Google News result page,
- scrap article's Date, Title, Content (eg. 30 pages),
- Loop through number of pages specified,
- save as JSON format for further analysis (eg. NLP, Sentiment Analysis, Text Mining, K-means clustering)
